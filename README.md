Hi, I'm Julien 👋🏻

I design and build websites, digital products and tools that empower creators, businesses, designers and entrepreneurs.

- My website templates have been downloaded by 6,000+ customers.
- I develop websites, apps and templates using modern tools like React, Astro and nocode platforms like Framer.


**Current projects:**
- [Frameplate](https:/frameplate.co) - a directory of Framer resources built by the community.
- [Frameplugins](https://frameplugins.com) - a curated directory of Framer plugins.
- [FrameShare](https://frameshare.social) - a Framer plugin to add share buttons to Framer websites.
- [UI Kits](https://frameplugins.com) - a curated directory of UI kits for web designers.
- [88 Pixels](https://88pixels.co) - a Framer agency offering services, website templates, products and plugins.
